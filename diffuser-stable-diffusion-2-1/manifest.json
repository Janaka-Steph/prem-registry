    "description": "Stable Diffusion v2-1 is an advanced version of the Stable Diffusion v2 model, developed by Robin Rombach and Patrick Esser. This model is designed to generate and modify images based on text prompts, utilizing a Latent Diffusion Model with a fixed, pretrained text encoder (OpenCLIP-ViT/H). The model was initially fine-tuned from the Stable Diffusion v2 model and then further trained for an additional 55k steps on the same dataset (with punsafe=0.1), and then fine-tuned for another 155k extra steps with punsafe=0.98.",
