# üìë Documentation

## üìå Description

Falcon-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-7B and finetuned on a mixture of chat/instruct datasets. The model is particularly designed for commercial use and its inference can be run on various GPU configurations. <a href='https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct' target='_blank'>Learn More</a>

## üíª Hardware Requirements

> **Memory requirements**: 27.69 GB (26406 MiB).

To run the `llama-2-13b` service, you'll need the following hardware configuration:

### Cloud Platforms

If you are using AWS:

- Instance Type: `p3.2xlarge` or higher
- GPU: NVIDIA A100, NVIDIA V100 (2x)

If you are using Paperspace:

- Instance Type: `V100-32G` or `A100` or higher
- GPU: NVIDIA A100, NVIDIA V100

### On-Premise Platforms

You'll need access to a GPU with the following options:
- A100 GPUs: A100 GPUs are preferred for training all model sizes, and are the only GPUs that can train the 13B param model in a reasonable amount of time.
- A10 GPUs: Training the 13B param model is not recommended on A10s.

## üìí Example Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt: Why do I need to run machine learning models on-premise?

> \nThe model runs on-premise, but the data runs in the cloud. The model is trained in the cloud, but the data is stored on-premise. The model is deployed on-premise, but the data is distributed in the cloud. The data is stored in the cloud, but the model is trained on-premise. You can use the data to train the model on-premise, but you can\u2019t use it to run the model in the cloud.\nWhy do I need to run machine


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt: How do I run my models on-premise?

> \\n\nI have been trained a model in Azure ML. I want to run it on-premise.\nThe only way I currently know is to download the model and run it locally, which is very inefficient.\nIs there a way to run the model on-premise without downloading it?\n\nComment: You can use the dockerfile for the model, which is available from the experiment summary.\n\nAnswer: Yes, you can use the \\strong{Dockerfile} for the model to run the model on-premise.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt: What are the limitations of running my models on-premise?

> \\nThe on-premise solution can be deployed in a private or public cloud. This solution is best suited for organizations with a large datacenter or on-premise infrastructure that they want to leverage for building and running models. On-premise deployments are also best suited for highly regulated industries that require data confidentiality and privacy.\nIs the on-premise solution based on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model?\nNo. It is based on a software


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt: What are the trade-offs of deploying models on-premise I should be aware of?

**Response 1:**
<blockquote>

\n\nComment: @snowman1391: I'm not sure I understand the trade-off question.  Is it about the performance of the models running on-premise vs. in the cloud?\n\nComment: @FrankHarrmann I'm wondering if you have ever worked with NVIDIA GPUs at all.  I'm specifically asking about the trade-offs of GPUs vs. CPUs, and I'm wondering if it's worth it for my

</blockquote>

**Response 2:**
<blockquote>
\n\nComment: @Anirudh I'm only aware of [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/220) and [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/3131) issue. I'm not aware of any issues in particular with the model's performance. Are you aware of any?\n\nComment: I haven't seen any issues with the model's performance in production. However, I believe it's

It's visible above from the outputs that model sometimes tends to hallucinate, generates out of context responses or just does text completion. We recommend users of Llama-V2 13B to develop guardrails and to take appropriate precautions for any production use as it's only a text generation model by default.

An example would be using a Chat Prompt Template as shown below:

Prompt:
```
You are an AI assistant in a conversational setting.
Provide a concise and accurate conversational answer to anything User asks.
===================

User: What are the trade-offs of deploying models on-premise I should be aware of?
Assistant:"""
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### ü¶úüîó Getting Started with Langchain

```bash
pip install langchain openai
```

It can be run simply using the langchain library as shown below:

```python
import os
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "random-string"

chat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="http://localhost:8229/v1", max_tokens=4096)
messages = [HumanMessage(content="What are the trade-offs of deploying models on-premise I should be aware of?")]
print(chat(messages))
```

For using it in a chat setting we recommend using a Chat Prompt Template as shown below:

> To know more on how to handle multi-turn conversation prompts specially for Llama-v2, check out: https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2#how-to-prompt-llama-2
    
```python

import os
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "random-string"

chat_template = """<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.

<</SYS>>

{user_message} [/INST]"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["user_message"],
    template=chat_template,
)

user_message = "Why do I need to run machine learning models on-premise?"

chat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="http://localhost:8229/v1", max_tokens=4096)
chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)
print(chain.run(user_message=user_message))
```

### üîé Quality Benchmarks

It outperforms comparable open-source models (e.g., MPT-7B, StableLM, RedPajama etc.)

Base model Falcon-7B is trained on English and French data only, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.

### üö´ Limitations and Biases

We have noticed that the model sometimes generates responses that are not relevant and mostly gibberish like letters and numbers or just repeating the same words. E.g - xjskdafhnwne$. Also we found that it generates hashtag like words like #falcon7b, #falcon7binstruct etc, which seems to be a bias coming from the finetuning data as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.

We recommend users of Falcon-7B-Instruct to develop guardrails and to take appropriate precautions for any production use.
