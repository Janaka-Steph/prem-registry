## 📌 Description

Stable Diffusion v1.5 is a sophisticated text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating high-quality images from textual prompts. Developed by Robin Rombach and Patrick Esser, this model is a significant upgrade from its predecessor, Stable Diffusion v1.2, having been fine-tuned on 595k steps at a resolution of 512x512 on `laion-aesthetics v2 5+` with a 10% drop in text-conditioning to enhance classifier-free guidance sampling. <a href='https://github.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion' target='_blank'>Learn More</a>.
