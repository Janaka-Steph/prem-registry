## üìå Description

[PGVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is an integration of PostgreSQL with vector-based operations and similarity searches. It allows you to store and query vector embeddings efficiently within the PostgreSQL database. PGVector is a powerful tool for building AI and ML applications that require similarity search capabilities. It supports:
- exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance

## üëá Getting Started (Implementation)

The service can be used with Langchain. You can check the [langchain pgvector documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/pgvector) for detailed usage instructions. In the code snippet below, we assume that you have installed the required dependencies present in *Pre-requisites* step and are using `all-miniLM-l6-v2` model for embeddings generation and the service is running locally on port `8444`.



### Pre-requisites
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently there's a bug in the latest version of langchain. Hence to use the pgvector integration on non-openai embeddings, you need to install the version mentioned below. The issue can be tracked [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/2219)
```bash
pip install pgvector tiktoken psycopg2-binary openai git+https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain.git@71d73a5f00dfd4e33a565762b7032d6b445d9bf6
```

```python

import os

from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.vectorstores.pgvector import PGVector

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "random-string"

doc1 = Document(page_content="Prem is an easy to use open source AI platform. With Prem you can quickly build provacy preserving AI applications.")
doc2 = Document(page_content="""
