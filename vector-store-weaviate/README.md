## ðŸ“Œ Description

<a href='https://weaviate.io/' target='_blank'>Weaviate</a> is an open-source, cloud-native vector database designed to enable machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for your data. It's built to handle large-scale data storage and search operations, making it a powerful tool for data scientists and developers working with big data <a href='https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate' target='_blank'>Learn more</a> ðŸš€.

## ðŸ‘‡ Getting Started (Implementation)

The service can be used with Langchain or the official weavaite python client (https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant). Below you can find an example using the service with Langchain. In the code snippet, we are assuming that you are using all-miniLM-l6-v2 model for embeddings generation and the service is running locally on port 8001.

```python

!pip install weaviate-client

import os

from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "random-string"

doc1 = Document(page_content="Prem is an easy to use open source AI platform. With Prem you can quickly build provacy preserving AI applications.")
doc2 = Document(page_content="""
Prem App

An intuitive desktop application designed to effortlessly deploy and self-host Open-Source AI models without exposing sensitive data to third-party.
