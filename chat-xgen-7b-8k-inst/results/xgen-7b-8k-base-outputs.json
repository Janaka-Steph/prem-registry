        "answer": "What are the benefits of cloud computing?\nCloud computing provides companies with flexibility, scalability and access to resources from anywhere. In a pandemic world, this can be a lifesaver, not only for business-as-usual operations, but especially for managing remote workers. It can also be used to keep the business afloat during unprecedented disasters like hurricanes or floods.\nAnother benefit is cost control. In a recent webinar, Andrew Chaves, chief commercial officer at Amazon Web Services (AWS), told attendees that the average AWS customer spends less than 5% of their IT budget on infrastructure.\nMore important, in a recent G"

        "question": "How does blockchain technology work?",
        "answer": "How does blockchain technology work?\nAccording to bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper, the blockchain network is composed of several types of nodes. Each node holds an identical copy of the database and can access it whenever they want. Nodes must operate in agreement in order to make sure that the network can remain secure and cannot be tampered with. Each node must be secure to be part of this system.\nNodes must be able to validate bitcoin transactions by following the instructions of the blockchain. In order to do this, users have their public keys, which are public and are given on other nodes. These public keys can then be used"

        "question": "How does quantum computing differ from classical computing?",
        "answer": "How does quantum computing differ from classical computing? The simplest way to state the difference is with the use of an analogy with classical music and classical computing. To take an example with classical music, a string bass is an example of a musical instrument producing a sound wave that consists of a succession of distinct \u2018syllables\u2019. An orchestra could play a Beethoven symphony with a succession of these different notes. It could play it in several different ways, with slight variations in timing or in how many syllables from the notes are played at once. For instance, a symphony can be played faster or slower, or it"
