    "description": "Stable Diffusion x2 latent upscaler is a sophisticated diffusion model that operates in the same latent space as the Stable Diffusion model, which is decoded into a full-resolution image. This upscaling model is designed explicitely for Stable Diffusion and works for images generated by other Stable Diffusion models. It is developed by Katherine Crowson in collaboration with Stability AI.",
