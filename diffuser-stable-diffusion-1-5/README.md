## üìå Description

Stable Diffusion v1.5 is a sophisticated text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating high-quality images from textual prompts. Developed by Robin Rombach and Patrick Esser, this model is a significant upgrade from its predecessor, Stable Diffusion v1.2, having been fine-tuned on 595k steps at a resolution of 512x512 on `laion-aesthetics v2 5+` with a 10% drop in text-conditioning to enhance classifier-free guidance sampling. <a href='https://github.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion' target='_blank'>Learn More</a>.

## üíª Hardware Requirements

To run the `stable-diffusion-1-5` service on Prem, you'll need access to a GPU with at least 16GiB of RAM.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### üöÄ Getting Started with OpenAI Python client

The service exposes the same `/image/generations` (for Text-to-Image) and `image/edits` (for Prompt+Image-to-Image) endpoints as OpenAI DALL-E does. You can directly use the official `openai` python library.

#### Text-to-Image

```python

!pip install openai
!pip install pillow

import io
import base64
import openai

from PIL import Image

openai.api_base = "http://localhost:9111/v1"
openai.api_key = "random-string"

response = openai.Image.create(
    prompt="Iron man portrait, highly detailed, science fiction landscape, art style by klimt and nixeu and ian sprigger and wlop and krenz cushart",
    n=1,
    size="512x512"
)

image_string = response["data"][0]["b64_json"]

img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(base64.decodebytes(bytes(image_string, "utf-8"))))
img.save("iron_man.jpeg")

```

#### Prompt + Image-to-Image

```python
import io
import base64
import openai

from PIL import Image

openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
openai.api_key = "random-string"

response = openai.Image.create_edit(
  image=open("astronaut.png", "rb"), #assuming you have an astronaut floating image
  prompt="astronaut floating in dark space, going down towards earth. Super high resolution, unreal engine, ultra realistic",
  n=1,
  guidance_scale=9,
  num_inference_steps=50,
  size="512x512",
)

image_string = response["data"][0]["b64_json"]
img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(base64.decodebytes(bytes(image_string, "utf-8"))))
img.save("astronaut_edit.png", "PNG")
```
