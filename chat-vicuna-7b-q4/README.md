## Description

Vicuna is an open-source chatbot, fine-tuned on LLaMA using conversations from ShareGPT. Developed collaboratively by a team from UC Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, and UC San Diego, this auto-regressive language model aims to advance research in large language models and chatbots. Primarily designed for researchers and hobbyists in AI and NLP, the model undergoes preliminary evaluations using diverse questions and GPT-4 for output judgment. The current model has been 4-bit quantized using ggml framework. [Learn More](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/)

## Example Usage

> Can you explain what is a large language model?

> Can you give some examples applications?

> Are there any limitations?

> Summarize the above in two sentences.

> Write me a story about a superstar.

## Technical Details
### Training / Fine Tuning Costs

After a significant effort spanning four days and a substantial expenditure of $800 for GPU rentals from providers such as Lambda Labs and Paperspace, the resulting model, named gpt4all-lora, is now up and running. This sum includes the costs incurred from several unsuccessful training attempts. In addition to the GPU costs, a further $500 was expended on the OpenAI API. However, with the model's release, the training duration has been drastically reduced. Now, the entire training process can be completed in approximately eight hours using Lambda Labs' DGX A100 8x 80GB setup, at a significantly reduced total cost of $100.

### Default Parameters

For our experiments, we have been using the following parameters:

```python
temperature=0.2
top_p=0.95
stop=[]
max_tokens=256
repeat_penalty=1.1
```
### Inference Benchmarks

### Quality Benchmarks

For more information concerning Vicuna evaluation method you can refer to https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/eval.

### Serving Details

In order to expose the service we are currently using FastAPI and llama-cpp-python library https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/ which is compatible with all ggml models.

```txt
llama-cpp-python==0.1.43
```

### Embeddings

The current model supports Embeddings generation too. Another endpoint is exposed for this purpose. You can check out the documentation for each container to see how to use it at http://{container_ip}:8000/docs or at our public services Open API doc at https://mock.prem.ninja/docs
