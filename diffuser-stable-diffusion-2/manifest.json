    "description": "Stable Diffusion v2 is an enhanced version of the Stable Diffusion v2-base model, developed by Robin Rombach and Patrick Esser. This model is designed to generate and modify images based on text prompts, utilizing a Latent Diffusion Model with a fixed, pretrained text encoder (OpenCLIP-ViT/H). The model was initially trained from the Stable Diffusion v2-base model and then further trained for an additional 150k steps using a v-objective on the same dataset. It was then resumed for another 140k steps on 768x768 images.",
